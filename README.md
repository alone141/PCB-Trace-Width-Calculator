# PCB-Trace-Width-Calculator
This program is designed for calculating the width of a trace on a PCB thats required to carry a given
current while keeping the resulting increase in trace temperature below a specified limit. The main
operations are:

1- Maximum current calculation from trace width in internal layer

2- Maximum current calculation from trace width in external layer

3- Minimum trace width calculation from currentin internallayer

4- Minimum trace width calculation from currentin external layer

User can choose the desired operation by entering corresponding number of the options on the
screen. After that in each section the user will be asked the enter the width value in mils or the
current value in miliamperes in 4 digits.
After that the program will do the necessary computations and will output the wanted values in
either mils or miliamperes.
